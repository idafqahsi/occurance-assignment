In this assignment you need to use three different collections implementations to store and show sorted
version of the output for the given problem, including processing time each implementation has taken.
Your code should take an input file from the user and counts the number of different words in the file along
with the number of occurrences of each word. Subsequently, the output would be given as follow: Different
words in the document in alphabetical order. Occurrence number of each word. The percentage of word
occurrence in the document. You should implement this functionality using three different objects from
Collection API. Moreover, you should report the execution time for each collection object you have used.
